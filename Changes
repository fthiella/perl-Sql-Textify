Revision history for Sql-Textify

0.04	13 September 2017
		- little fixes to make CPAN tests happy
		- new test suites, I'm not using test::most anymore
		- test sqlite only if DBD::Sqlite is installed

0.03	13 September 2017
		- better regexp for removing C-style comments
		- also there's no need for sqltextify.pl to split the string (the textify script will do everything already) so I removed the split code.

0.02	13 September 2017
		Little internal changes, updated Makefile.PL

0.01    10 September 2017
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
        It contains the module Sql-Textify and the script sqltextify.pl.
